1. After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain?
-Because the swap function not only swap the objects' value but also their address
jungleDVD becomes cinderellaDVD
cinderellaDVD becomes jungleDVD
=> values of the objects still remain

2.After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed?
-Because the change function created new DVD and set its title by ciderella.

3.Suggestion: Write a getDetail() method for the DigitalVideoDisc class. What should be the return type of
this method?
-If getDetail() method is needed, its return type should be String of values
Ex: "Aladin, Animation,18.99"
